# k8s-cluster-kubeadm-terraform-ansible
Create the K8s Cluster using Terraform and Ansible on AWS EC2 instances.

This repository contains Terraform and Ansible scripts to set up Kubeadm-based Kubernetes cluster on AWS EC2 instances. With this, one can form a single master node cluster or a single master-multiple worker node cluster to dive deep into Kubernetes concepts and prepare for Kubernetes-based certifications.

The repository has the following branches:
- [single-master](https://github.com/cloudyuga/k8s-cluster-kubeadm-terraform-ansible/tree/single-master): This branch contains scripts to launch the Kubernetes cluster with CNI.
- [single-master-sc](https://github.com/cloudyuga/k8s-cluster-kubeadm-terraform-ansible/tree/single-master-sc): This branch contains scripts to launch the Kubernetes cluster with CNI and storage class.
- [single-master-sc-ingress](https://github.com/cloudyuga/k8s-cluster-kubeadm-terraform-ansible/tree/single-master-sc-ingress): This branch contains scripts to launch the Kubernetes cluster with CNI, storage class, and Ingress Controller.
